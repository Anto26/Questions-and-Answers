# Questions-and-Answers

A testing software, that reads from a file the questions and the answers and saves the name, surname and grade (max grade 10) of the user, after finishing the test.

To add some questions and answers it is just needed to:

  - Create a text file called "questions_answers_database";
  
  - Write in it a question and under that four answers;
  
  - Put a '-' before the correct answer
  
  - Do all the steps again

It can be seen the current questions_answers_database.txt, to understand how to write, in the correct manner, that file.
