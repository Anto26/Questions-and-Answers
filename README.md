# Questions-and-Answers

A testing software, that reads from a file questions and answers and saves the name, surname and grade (max grade 10) of the user, after finishing the test.

To add some questions and answers in the program, you just need to:

  -Create a text file called "questions_answers_database"
  
  -Write in it the question, under that four answers (read questions_answers_database.txt)
  
  -Put a '-' before the correct answer
